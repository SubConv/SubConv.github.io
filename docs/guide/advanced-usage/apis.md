# APIs
The subsection converter is actually an API. And to support proxy-provider, I implemented another API.  
Here I'm gonna introduce the APIs.  

## GET /sub
This is the API for subsection converter. It's contained in the link generated by the web ui.  
It accepts GET requests. Here're the parameters:  

| Parameter | Description | Optional | Default | Remarks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| url | The URL of the original subscription or node sharing link. **It needs to be URIComponent encoded.** | No | - | Multiple subscription links are supported. You can use line breaks or "|" to separate them. |
| interval | The interval of proxy update. | Yes | 1800 | Unit: seconds. |
| urlstandby | The URL of the standby subscription or node sharing link. The proxies in it will only be added to the **manual switch group** (the group whose `"manual"` is `True` in the configuration file), and will not be classified into region groups. **It's recommended to be URIComponent encoded.** | Yes | - | Multiple subscription links are supported. You can use line breaks or "|" to separate them. |
| short | If this parameter is set (regardless of its value), the header section and dns section containing allow-lan will not be generated. | Yes | - | - |
| npr | If this parameter is set (regardless of its value), the URL of the ruleset will not be proxied. | Yes | - | By default, this service is used to proxy the URL of the ruleset to ensure that the ruleset can be obtained normally. If this parameter is set, the URL of the ruleset will not be proxied. |

## GET /provider
This API converts the subscription to the configuration required by proxy-provider. This API will be called whenever the proxy is updated via proxy-provider.

It accepts GET requests. Here're the parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Optional | Default | Remarks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| url | The URL of the original subscription. **It needs to be URIComponent encoded.** | No | - | Should be a single subscription link. |

## GET /proxy
This API is used to access the specified URL through this service.
It accepts GET requests. Here're the parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Optional | Default | Remarks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
